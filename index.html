		<h1><a class="r" href="history.html">P</a>ARUPAINT</h1>
		<p>Parupaint is my oekaki-applet inspired drawing program! I started working on it in 2012 after growing frustrated with the lack of programs that, first of all, had proper frame-by-frame animation support and second of all, had good collaborative features over the internet.</p>
		<p>I designed it to be a light, straightforward and portable program, not only with the single executable file, but also with the interface. There are very few buttons to press on, as i think that it breaks your workflow when using a tablet. As a result, hotkeys are a main focus, and while there may be a learning curve it will help you work very efficiently. The brushes, patterns and interface style are all inspired from oekaki applets.</p>
		<p>Parupaint has simple animation support that takes layers one step further by basing them on frames. In the world of expensive, complex and foreign animation programs, i believe that this simple system fills a void - a program that lets you quickly get up and animate frame by frame without any previous experience. An mspaint for animations, if you will.
		<p>And as a fan of collaboration over the internet, Parupaint is based on a server/client model that allows you to draw with others. It uses the websocket technology which allows people to join in and draw through, for example, a web browser if they can't run the application. Parupaint at school, anyone?</p>
