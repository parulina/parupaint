		<h1>PARUPAINT</h1>
		<p>Parupaint is a oekaki inspired drawing program! I started working on it in 2012, after growing frustrated with the lack of program that worked the way i wanted. Nowadays i don't use this program as much, but it is very fun to draw with your friends with this. Plus, it's a nice project to work on.</p>
		<p>I designed parupaint to be a light, straightforward and portable program, not only with a single executable, but also with the interface. There are very little buttons to press on, as i think that it breaks your workflow when using a tablet. As a result, hotkeys are a main focus, and while there may be a learning curve, it will help you work very efficiently. The brushes in this program are inspired from oekaki applets. I made them all aliased, no smooth brushes, because i think that is the most straightforward way of drawing.</p>
		<p>As a fan of anything multiplayer, i designed the program around a server/client model allowing you to draw with others. It uses websockets, which allows those without the program to access the server through, for example, the web browser.</p>
		<p>The program also supports making animations.</p>
